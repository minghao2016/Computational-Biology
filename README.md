# CompBio
Computational Biology Final Project:

Running covariance_matrix.py:
1) The program expects an input graphs dataset, and output file into which the result will be written and a parameter k(number of power iterations, default = 5).
2) command to run the program:	python covariance_matrix.py --input dataset_2 --output outfile --k 5

Threaded version of the program will be uploaded shortly.
